        Any styling of the adventure is provided by the HTML.
        
        In addition to whatever tags the page author provides, CYA will
        generate tags like the following:

            <a class="cya_choice">An available choice</a>
            <a class="cya_accepted_choice">A past choice that was taken</a>
            <a class="cya_rejected_choice">A past choice that wasn't taken</a>
            <div class="cya_page">Surrounds each complete page</div>
        
        This example Adventure also provides rudimentary styling for the raw
        "source elements". Remove `display: none;` from the `#pages` rule to
        see.
